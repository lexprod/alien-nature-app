# alien-nature-app
This is a site/app used by surveyors researching flora on a fictional alien planet,
combining a database of plants and a map. In-universe, this is a utility intended to keep
track of identified species and their hazards/uses. Out-of-universe, this is an interactive
storytelling project, with little asides in the entries cluing the reader into a sense of a
larger world, and a possibility to participate by adding your own entries.



The Basics:
1. A main page explaining the project and laying out some background information
about this planet.
2. A database page with a table/list of all currently identified species, with a working
name, description, and the name of the surveyor who wrote it. A few written entries.
3. An about-the-developer page with contact information.


Potential Extra Features, in order:
1. A (fictional) topographic map with a coordinate system and markers indicating
locations of found flora. Clicking on one will bring up the relevant entry.
2. Adding a section of lab notes and assessment tags to the database entries
(poisonous/hazardous/safe/edible/etc).
3. Sorting features on the database page, allowing the user to search for specific
tags/features. Adding fields with specific options to select, streamlining specific kinds of
observations (soil conditions, shade/sun exposure, etc)
5. Allowing the user to add an entry to the database, and click on a point on the map to
mark it. Submitting it will "send it to the lab", eg. send the form to me to edit and assign
tags before posting it to the website.
